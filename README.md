# Project-Admin-Dashboard

The admin Dashboard is the second project for the FullStack JavaScript module on The Odin Project. This mock admin dashboard was built as a way to showcase the CSS grid knowledge that has been taught so far in this course. The webpage is fully responsive, becoming a single column of content for mobile viewing.
